/// Creates middleware that routes requests using the provided [router].
///
/// This function converts a [Router] into middleware that can be used in a
/// [Pipeline]. When a request matches a route, the associated value is
/// converted to a [Handler] and invoked. If no route matches (path miss),
/// the next handler in the pipeline is called. If the path matches but the
/// method doesn't (method miss), a 405 response is returned with the Allow
/// header listing supported methods.
///
/// Path parameters, matched path, and remaining path from the routing lookup
/// are accessible via [RequestContextEx] extensions on the context passed to
/// handlers.
///
/// **Note:** For [Router<Handler>], prefer using [Router.use] for middleware
/// composition, [Router.fallback] for 404 handling, and [RouterHandler.call]
/// to use the router directly as a handler. This avoids the need for
/// [Pipeline] and provides better composability.
///
/// Preferred approach:
/// ```dart
/// final router = Router<Handler>()
///   ..get('/users/:id', userHandler)
///   ..use('/', logRequests())
///   ..fallback = notFoundHandler;
///
/// await serve(router.call, ...);
/// ```
///
/// This function is primarily useful for [Router<T>] where `T` is not
/// [Handler], requiring conversion via [toHandler]:
///
/// ```dart
/// final router = Router<String>()
///   ..get('/hello', 'Hello World');
///
/// final handler = const Pipeline()
///     .addMiddleware(routeWith(
///       router,
///       toHandler: (message) => respondWith(
///         (_) => Response.ok(body: Body.fromString(message))
///       ),
