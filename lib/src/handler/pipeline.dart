/// A helper that makes it easy to compose a set of [Middleware] and a
/// [Handler].
///
/// Middleware are executed in the order they are added, processing the request
/// top-down and the response bottom-up.
///
/// ## Basic Pipeline
///
/// ```dart
/// var handler = const Pipeline()
///     .addMiddleware(loggingMiddleware)
///     .addMiddleware(cachingMiddleware)
///     .addHandler(application);
/// ```
///
/// ## Execution Order
///
/// ```dart
/// // Request flows down:
/// // 1. Logging middleware (request)
/// // 2. Auth middleware (request)
/// // 3. Handler
/// // 4. Auth middleware (response)
/// // 5. Logging middleware (response)
///
/// final handler = const Pipeline()
///     .addMiddleware(loggingMiddleware)    // First to see request
///     .addMiddleware(authMiddleware)       // Second to see request
///     .addHandler(apiHandler);             // Last to process
/// ```
///
/// Note: this package also provides `addMiddleware` and `addHandler` extensions
/// members on [Middleware], which may be easier to use.

  /// Creates a new, empty pipeline.
  const Pipeline();

  /// Returns a new [Pipeline] with [middleware] added to the existing set of
  /// [Middleware].
  ///
  /// [middleware] will be the last [Middleware] to process a request and
  /// the first to process a response.

  /// Returns a new [Handler] with [handler] as the final processor of a
  /// [Request] if all of the middleware in the pipeline have passed the request
  /// through.
