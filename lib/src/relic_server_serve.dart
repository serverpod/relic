/// A Relic Server adapter for handling [HttpRequest] objects from `dart:io`'s

/// One can provide an instance of [HttpServer] as the `requests` parameter in

///
/// This adapter supports request hijacking; see [Request.hijack].
///
/// [Request]s passed to a [Handler] will contain the [Request.context] key

/// the underlying [HttpRequest].
///
/// When creating [Response] instances for this adapter, you can set the
/// `"relic.server.buffer_output"` key in [Response.context]. If `true`,
/// (the default), streamed responses will be buffered to improve performance.
/// If `false`, all chunks will be pushed over the wire as they're received.
/// See [HttpResponse.bufferOutput] for more information.
